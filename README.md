# Demo
  The search for modern information increasingly calls for effective techniques and models for analysis in morphologically complex languages. Moreover, the Qur'anic text represents an unquestionable terminological and ontological reference for the Arabic language. We will therefore try to demonstrate the specificities of the Koranic text whose relevant features are often related to the principle of iterativeness. 

  The objective of this project is to develop a qualitative and quantitative analysis at the level of the verses of the Qur'an in order to derive expressive data around the sacred book.

  Having deepened our theoretical knowledge of text analysis and its techniques, the Natural Language Processing, as well as the Topic Modeling, the statistical studies and analyses that will be carried out on the text will be considered as an application of this learning. To do this, we used the Python programming language known for these rich libraries, and which is significantly leader in the field of Data Analytics.
